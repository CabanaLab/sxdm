    "#### Importing Images\n",
    "You must call\n",
    "`import_images(file, images_loc, scans=False, fill_num=4, delete=False, import_type='uint32', delimeter_function=func, force_reimport=False)` \n",
    "before anything else. This will load in all the diffraction images for the scans the User would like to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **file** - the location of the .h5 file you created through the matlab code - `'/path/to/file/test.h5'`\n",
    "1. **images_loc** - the location of the images folder you would like to import - `'/path/to/folder/holding/all/image/data'`\n",
    "1. **scans** - if left False it will import the entire folder. If you set it to an nd.array it will only import those scans - `False` or `[351]`\n",
    "1. see documentation for the rest of the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Detector Channels\n",
    "Run `disp_det_chan(file)` to copy and paste the output into a notebook. Then assign appropriate values to each variable.\n",
    "Then run `setup_det_chan(file, fluor, roi, detector_scan, filenumber, sample_theta, hybrid_x, hybrid_y, mis)` to set the detector channel. If you need to redo these vaiables run `del_det_chan(file)`, change the detector values and rerun `setup_det_chan(variables)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**fluor** (dic) The User can place as many Fluorescence dictionary entries as they would like. Except there must be at least 1. Entries can be named however the User would like. \n",
    "\n",
    "**roi** (dic) The User can place as many Region of Interest dictionary entries as they would like. Except there must be at least 1. Entries can be named however the User would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**detector_scan** (dic) Main_Scan must be the first and only dictionary entry. This corresponds to the scan where the User rocked the detector. This will be used to determine the x and y angle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**filenumber** (int) This must be a single integer value corresponding to the detector channel accociated with the filenumbers of the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**sample_theta** (int) This must be a single integer value corresponding to the detector channel accociated wih the sample theta angle.\n",

    "\n",
    "**mis** (dic) The User can place as many miscellaneous (mis) dictionary entries as they would like. Except there must be at least 1. Entries can be named however the User would like. None of these are in use in SXDM-1.0. They are there for User additions. \n",

    "#### Setting Up Framset\n",
    "Initiating all required data as well as setting up the frameset can be started with the following code\n",
    "\n",
    "`file = 'path/to/file/test.h5'` \n",
    "\n",
    "`scan_numbers = [int, int, int]` - the scan numbers the user would like to import for a given dataset/FOV\n",

    "`test_fs = SXDMFrameset(file, dataset_name, scan_numbers = scan_numbers)` - class object \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensions Check** - starting the SXDMFrameset will automatically determine the pixel X resolution for all the imported scans as well as all the Y resolutions for all the scans and checks to make sure every scan has identical X resolutions and every scan has identical Y resolutions. Then it checks to see if the median(x) and median(y) resoltuions are equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the program throws an error during the resolution check \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you have set the hybrid_x and hybrid_y values correctly in the `setup_det_chan()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pull up all the scan resolutions with `test_fs.all_res_x`, and `test_fs.all_res_y`. These will be in the same order as `test_fs.scan_numbers`. Remove the scan that is throwing the error when setting up `test_fs = SXDMFrameset()`. Future versions will resample the scans to create identical resolutions in all X, all Y, and in X v. Y. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Alignment\n",
    "Aligning the scan can be carried out through the following code and following the GUI. Alignment can only be done of the Fluorscence images or the Region of Interest images set in the `setup_det_chan()` function. User will define which one to use in the GUI. Once all alignment centers have been set, it is ok to just quit out of the windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "`test_fs.alignment(reset=False)`\n",

    "\n",
    "`test_fs.gaus_checker(center_around=False, default=false)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**center_around** - if set to `-1` this will not center the ROI maps\n",
    "\n",
    "**default** - if set to True this will default to the first ROI set in the `setup_det_chan()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "x and y values for the plot are stored as `x, y = test_fs.mda_roi_gaus_check` \n",

    "\n",
    "###### test_fs.roi_segmentation(self, bkg_multiplier=0)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**columns** - total amount of columns in the scans\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "See documentation for rest of the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "This calles the `pixel_analysis_v2()` function and vectorizes it for faster run times.\n",
