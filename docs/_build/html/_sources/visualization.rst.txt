Visualization of Results
========================

Region of Interest Viewer
-------------------------

Xanespy includes a graphical user interface that allows for
interactive visualization of X-ray frames and maps. The viewer is
launched from the command line and takes the path to a processed HDF
file as its input. For some extra functionality, you can give the name
of a metal K- of L- edge using the ``-k`` or ``-l`` argument
respectively. See ``xanespy-viewer --help`` for a list of K and L
edges available.
