# pixel grabs
# reloading saved data

# show figure of summed diffraction pattern

# allow user to make boxes - as many as they want

# store the box crops

# go through every pixel and crop the diffraction pattern accoring to user

# sum in 2theta direction

# median blur array

# sum all the values

# store pixel intensity to its own array





# i want the roi for each theta completely different and corrected with my program
# i want to be able to segment of each pixel diffraction and create an roi for different regions of the diffraction pattern



## there are roi's for each scan then a summed roi and a gausian_check that can be done
## I want the function parameters in textboxes



## create a GUI which actually selects the bounding boxes
# has the summed diffraction pattern
# has vmin and vmax values
# allows the user to make boxes
# allows the users to delete certain bounding boxes
# have a complete button to move on


# Top plot of the gaussian check
# bottom left have a way to flick through the rois
# bottom right summed roi
# be able to click on the scan_roi and pull up the median_blur_data for it
# show the median_blur_data


## there are different boxes the user can select and see their roi maps and their summed roi colormap
# left side had a figure where the user selects roi boxes
# create a way to flick through all the boxes roi individually
# right summing all the roi boxes as difference colors
# bottom plot show the gaussian curve for the current selected bounding ox the user is viewing (center)
# show the median_blur_data depending where the user clicks and which scan they click
